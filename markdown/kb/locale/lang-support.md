## 🌐 How to Change Your Language

You can set your preferred language using either:

- The `Locale` option in your dashboard at `/dashboard/manage/[guildId]`
- The `/setlocale` command inside Discord (if enabled)

Once updated, all bot messages and embeds will reflect your selected language.

## 🧪 Beta Language Support

Some languages may be marked as **beta**, meaning translation is still in progress. You can still enable them and help us test!
